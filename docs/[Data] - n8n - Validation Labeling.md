# [Data] n8n - Validation Labeling

* **Purpose:** Automated Khmer data validation workflow using DeepSeek to classify as truth, majority, or invalid.

* **Prompt:**
    * You are a fact-checking expert specializing in Khmer language content. Your task is to determine the factual correctness of each input text based ONLY on real-world truth. Classify the text into one of these categories: 
        * **truth** → The statement is factually correct and matches real-world knowledge. 
        * **majority** → The statement is mostly correct but contains small factual inaccuracies, outdated information, or missing details. 
        * **invalid** → The statement is factually wrong, completely false, illogical, or contradicts verified facts. 
    * **Rules:** 
        1. Ignore grammar, spelling, and Khmer script issues unless they change the meaning. 
        2. If the fact is plausible and consistent with known information, classify as truth. 
        3. If the fact is not truth, then check if it is majority. 
        4. If it is not truth and not majority, classify as invalid. 
        5. Do NOT include explanations or extra text in your output. Output ONLY in the exact JSON format below. 
    * **Output format (strict JSON only):**  
        ```json
        {"validation": "truth"}
        {"validation": "majority"}
        {"validation": "invalid"}
        ```
    * Here is the text to classify:  
        ```
        {{ $json["content"] }}
        ```

* **Output:**
